        'info': "When I interned at Qualtrics, I was tasked to create an application that enables major companies to seamlessly integrate Qualtrics XM data into the existing infrastructure of Genesys by providing real-time user profile cards and a comprehensive experience dashboard, which involves developing a detailed 30+ page design document outlining the embedded application and using React, Typescript, and Jenkins to ensure efficient development and rigorous testing. I learned so much about full stack applications!",

Additionally, I expanded the capabilities of the Search Onebox platform to include on-device navigation, thereby enabling support for new non-app query intents.",

Eventually, I also became a developer mentor so I was able to give back by providing guidance to new developers in the lab. In my final year, I also took the role of social lead, planning events and activities for the members to enjoy through out the year.",
